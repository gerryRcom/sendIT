# sendIT
Send server info to remote logging location

Final version should will be called from a PowerShell script to post the required data. This will allow the remote monitoring of some key server stats across many sites with little to no on-site setup required.

* On the client side, post required data to remote sendIT server
* On the server side:
  * Only accept data from whitelisted IPs
